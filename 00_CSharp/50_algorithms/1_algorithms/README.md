## By Paradigm 

### Brute Force 
> look at all the possibilities and selects the best solution

- Linear Search

### Greedy 
> choose the best option at the current time, without any consideration for the future

- ???

### Divide and Conquer 
> divide the problem into smaller parts and then solve those parts

- Binary Search
- Merge Sort
- Quicksort


### Dynamic Programming 
> build up a solution using previously found sub-solutions

- Fibonacci Number
