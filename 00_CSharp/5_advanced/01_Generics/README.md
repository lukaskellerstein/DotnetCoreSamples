Advantages of Generics

1) Reusability: You can use a single generic type definition for multiple purposes in the same code without any method overriding or code modification. For example, you can create a generic method to perform a math operation. You could then use the method to perform the same operation on double float, or int.

2) Type Safety: Generic data types provide better type safety, especially in the case of collections, which is where you will most likely be using them the most from the System.Collections.Generics namespace.

3) Performance: Generic types provide better performance because they reduce the need for boxing, unboxing
